## Background and Research:

Syrian crisis is the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War
II and it is a live problem that is still left unresolved. 
Every year level of crisis expands and war keeps going. 
As a student coming from Turkey, one of the neighboring countries 
of Syria and the country with the highest level of refugees,
I had the chance to closely observe this issue year by year.
In this project I hope to analyze data provided by non-profit
humanitarian organizations and if time allows data from web in
order to shed light to this problem and I hope to attract 
attention of more people to share this concern. 

## Project Objectives:

The main objective of this project is to create awareness for
the refugee crisis and next to show patterns by summarizing and
visualizing data in order to better understand the patterns behind it. 

## Questions Yet to be Answered:

- [How is immigration from Syria since 2011 ?](https://github.com/KeremTurgutlu/syrian_crisis/blob/master/Syrian%20Refugee%20Crisis%20-%20Sandbox.ipynb) 
- How this is related with events in the area and actions of the countries of interest.
- Who is affected the most from this crisis, which demographics ?
- What is the pattern of refugees, which paths do they follow ?
- How other countries react to this issue and what kind of actions do they take towards it ?
