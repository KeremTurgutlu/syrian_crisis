#### Background and Research:

Syrian crisis is the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War
II and it is a live problem that is still left unresolved. 
Every year level of crisis expands and war keeps going. 
As a student coming from Turkey, one of the neighboring countries 
of Syria and the country with the highest level of refugees,
I had the chance to closely observe this issue year by year.
In this project I hope to analyze data provided by non-profit
humanitarian organizations and if time allows data from web in
order to shed light to this problem and I hope to attract 
attention of more people to share this concern. 

#### Project Objectives:

The main objective of this project is to create awareness for
the refugee crisis and next to show patterns by summarizing and
visualizing data in order to better understand the patterns behind it. 

#### Questions Yet to be Answered:

- [How is immigration from Syria since 2011 ?](https://github.com/KeremTurgutlu/syrian_crisis/blob/master/Syrian%20Refugee%20Crisis%20-%20Sandbox.ipynb) 
- How this is related with events in the area and actions of the countries of interest.
- Who is affected the most from this crisis, which demographics ?
- What is the pattern of refugees, which paths do they follow ?
- How other countries react to this issue and what kind of actions do they take towards it ?


#### Data Sources:

####1) Data from UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR):**

[Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/refugee-data)

- Asylum monthly applications opened (asylum_seekers_monthly.csv)
- Yearly progress through the refugee system (asylum_seekers.csv)
- Refugee demographics (demographics.csv)
- Yearly time series data on UNHCRâ€™s populations of concern (time_series.csv)
- Yearly population statistics on refugees by residence and destination (persons_of_concern.csv)
- Yearly data on resettlement arrivals, with or without UNHCR assistance (resettlement.csv)

#### 2) Casualty Reports from the Violations Documentation Center in Syria.

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) provide a simple way to make a
website using
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com).

For me, the painful aspects of making a website are

- Working with html and css
- Finding a hosting site
- Transferring stuff to the hosting site

With [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), you just write things in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[GitHub](https://github.com) hosts the site for you, and you just push
material to your GitHub repository with `git add`, `git commit`, and
`git push`.

If you love [git](https://git-scm.com/) and
[GitHub](https://github.com), you'll love
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), too.

The sites use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a
[ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) [gem](https://rubygems.org/), to
convert Markdown files to html, and this part is done
automatically when you push the materials to the `gh-pages` branch
of a GitHub repository.

The [GitHub](https://pages.github.com) and
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) documentation is great, but I thought it
would be useful to have a minimal tutorial, for those who just want to
get going immediately with a simple site. To some readers, what GitHub
has might be simpler and more direct.  But if you just want to create
a site like the one you're looking at now, read on.

Start by reading the [Overview page](pages/overview.html), which
explains the basic structure of these sites. Then read
[how to make an independent website](pages/independent_site.html). Then
read any of the other things, such as
[how to test your site locally](pages/local_test.html).

- [Overview](pages/overview.html)
- [Making an independent website](pages/independent_site.html)
- [Making a personal site](pages/user_site.html)
- [Making a site for a project](pages/project_site.html)
- [Making a jekyll-free site](pages/nojekyll.html)
- [Testing your site locally](pages/local_test.html)
- [Resources](pages/resources.html)

If anything here is confusing (or _wrong_!), or if I've missed
important details, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site/issues), or (even
better) fork [the GitHub repository for this website](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site),
make modifications, and submit a pull request.
